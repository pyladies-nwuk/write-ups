Dear <name>

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I am <name>, one of the cofounders of the PyLadies NorthWest UK chapter. I am writing to ask if you'd be interested in supporting the newly formed Pyladies chapter for women in open source software: PyLadies NorthWest.

Pyladies (www.pyladies.com) is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become more active participants and leaders in the Python programming and the broader open source software community. We promote, educate and advance a diverse community through outreach, education, conferences, events, social gatherings and mentorship programmes.

Growth of the tech community in the North West of England over the past few years has been exciting and rapid. In particular, the growth of Python has increased massively. It is a well known fact that there are many under-represented groups in tech though, and we are hoping to help change that. We are starting a PyLadies chapter serving Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Liverpool. We want to bring fresh talent into the commercial and open source community and support both seasoned and budding developers through workshops, community activities, and local advocacy.  As opposed to other chapters we are focusing on all minority genders in our community, including cis/trans women, trans men, non-conforming, and agender.

At the moment we have three (?) organisers/founders, and the news of the chapter formation has already started to spread out. Now, we are currently looking for sponsors to support the group and its activities.  

Here are sthe ways you can help us:
- Providing a space for us to host events in any of our principal chapter cities (Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield).
- Financial support to cover catering of some of the events, pay for speakers or mentors occasional travel for a specific event, etc.
- Recommending a speaker from your company for one of our events

In return for space and financial support we can offer:
- Tweets/social media posts about your support in advertising of meetups
- Advertisements of current job openings to attendees
- Space for company logo’s on our website
- Display of advertising material at the event (banners, stickers etc)

Your support of PyLadies' outreach efforts will pay off hugely over the long term by improving the diversity of the software industry as a whole.

If you consider that your company would be able to provide some support to the group please do not hesitate to contact us at nwuk@pyladies.com. We appreciate any help and hope you’ll join us in providing an encouraging and safe space for minorities in tech.

The PyLadies NW UK organisers,
Tania, Kat and Hannah
