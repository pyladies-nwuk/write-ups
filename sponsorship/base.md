Dear <name>

I hope you are well. I am <name>, one of the cofounders of the PyLadies NorthWest UK chapter. I wondered if you'd be interested in supporting this newly formed Pyladies chapter for women in open source software.

Pyladies (www.pyladies.com) is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become more active participants and leaders in the Python and the broader open source software community. We promote, educate and advance a diverse community through outreach, education, conferences, events, social gatherings and mentorship programmes.

The tech community in the NorthWest of England has grown a lot over the last few years. And we decided it was time to start a PyLadies chapter serving Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Liverpool. We want to bring fresh talent into the open source community and support both seasoned and budding developers through workshops, community activities, and local advocacy.  As opposed to other chapters we are focusing on all minority genders in our community,  including cis/trans women, trans men, non-conforming, and agender.

At the moment we have four organisers/founders, and the news of the chapter formation have already started to spread out. Thus we are currently looking for sponsors to support the group and its activities.  

There are some ways you can help us:
- Providing a space for us to host events in any of our principal chapter cities (Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield).
- Financial support to cover catering of some of the events, pay for speakers or mentors occasional travel for a specific event, etc.
- Recommending a speaker from your company for one of our events

Your support of PyLadies' outreach efforts will pay off hugely over the long term by improving the diversity of the software industry as a whole.

If you consider that your company would be able to provide some support to the group please do not hesitate to contact us at nwuk@pyladies.com.

The PyLadies NW UK organisers,
Tania, Kat and Hanna
